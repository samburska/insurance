# insurance
My very first project. 

I analyse insurance plan to choose the best one for my family.
There are two possibilities:
1. Paying monthly less. Fare will be fixed till 75 years
2. Paying monthly more, but in 75 years if you didn't use insurance you'll receive all paied money back.

I take into account inflation rate and calculate how much I can receive if I make investments on the amount of difference between two fares. 

All results are shown on the charts.
