## Insurance plans comparison

My very first project. I tried to use as many different functions as possible just for practice. So, sometimes it could be not very logical structurally but it was useful for me to remember them :)

It's a real life project. I should choose a "critical illness insurance" plan for my family.
There are two possibilities:
1. Paying less - **84$** monthly for both adults. Fare will be fixed till 75 years old.
2. Paying more - **139$** monthly, but at 75 years old, if you didn't use insurance, you'll receive all paied money back.

Which plan to choose? It seams like a good option to choose the second one. Or you will use it or everything you paid will be reimbursed. Let investigate it.

Total amount paid during 40 years vs inflation

I take into account inflation rate and calculate how much I can receive if I make investments on the amount of difference between two fares. 

All results are shown on the charts.
